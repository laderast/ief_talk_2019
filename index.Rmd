# Overview

- Why teach bioinformatics students about clinical data?
  - Encourage translational research
- How do we teach them?
  - Clinical Data Wrangling
  - Data Analytics
  - BioData Club
- Who are examples of our success?
  - Gabby Choonoo
  - Connor Smith

---
# Motivation: Why?

- Research is multi-disciplinary
- Need for Translational Research Workforce
- Bridge gaps between computational biology and clinical realms

---
# Bioinformatics Students: Clinical Data Opportunities

- Clinical Data Wrangling Workshop
- BMI569 Data Analytics
- BioData Club

---
# Clinical Data Wrangling

- Designed for both clinical and bioinformatics students
- Introduce students to data quality issues with clinical data
- Use Sleep Heart Health Study data
  - Partnership with http://sleepdata.org
- http://laderast.github.io/clinical_data_wrangling/

# Outcomes

- Currently assessing impact on students

---
# BMI569: Data Analytics

- Summer Hybrid Course taught jointly with Kaiser Permanente
- Focus on helping make decisions in a Health Care Setting
- Sociotechnical challenges in implementing a predictive model
  - Implementing a predictive model (R-based)
  - Organizational Lectures and Challenges from Kaiser

# BMI569: Practical Coursework

- 8 weeks online coursework in R/SQL and 1 week in person
- Patients assess and query a simulated data warehouse
- Rmarkdown document based assignments
  - provide guidance 
- http://laderast.github.io/AnalyticsCourse

---
# Mixing Clinical and Bioinformatics

- Roughly 50% Clinical/50% Bioinformatics
- Opportunity! Pair them up for joint learning
- Learn skills and challenges from each other

---
# Goals

.pull-left[
- Predict 30-day hospital readmissions
- Joining/Querying/Data
- Implementing the LACE metric and assessing it
- Kaiser Experience in Implementation and Impact
- Communicating your results to an executive team]
