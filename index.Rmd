# Applies to Informaticians, Too

![](image/wilkinson-revised.png)

- Emphasize successful informatics being collaboration
- Research is multi-disciplinary
- Need for Translational Research Workforce
- Bridge gaps between computational biology and clinical realms

---
# Luckily, there was funding

- NLM T15 Training Grant Supplement for Data Science
- Allowed a diverse team to come together:
    - Eilis Boudreau, MD/PhD (Sleep Neurologist)
    - Nicole Weiskopf, PhD (EHR Data Quality)
    - Ted Laderas, PhD (Education, Interactive Visualization)

# Clinical Data Wrangling

.pull-left[
- Workshop for incoming graduate students
- Audience: Clinical/Bioinformatics Students
  - Assumes no expertise with R/RStudio
- Introduce students to data quality issues with clinical data
- Context: Secondary use of a clinical dataset
  - Can we use it for prediction of cardiovascular disease?
  - What variables can we use?

# Learning Objectives

.pull-left[
1. **Understand** the biology of sleep and sleep apnea and how the biology informs the covariates measured in the Sleep Heart Health Study
1. **Understand** the usefulness and challenges with working with clinical data
1. **Learn** Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and use them to **inform/analyse** model building
1. **Build** and **Evaluate** a predictive model (logistic regression) using simple diagnostics.
1. **Communicate** your findings in a team setting.

# Challenges: Where to get data?

- Partnership with National Sleep Research Resource 
    - http://sleepdata.org
- Sleep Heart Health Study data 
    - ~5700 patients, 1200 covariates
- Requires students to sign [data use agreement]()

---
## Sleep Covariates

```{r echo=FALSE}
dict <- read.csv("data_description.csv")
gt(dict[1:10,-1])
```

# Workshop is split over multiple days

.pull-left[
- **Day 1** (8 Hrs):
  - Logistics
  - Intro to sleep data
  - Intro to data reuse and data quality
  - Data exploration of sleep data
  - Intro to logistic regression
  ]
.pull-right[
- **Day 2** (2 hrs): 
  - Logistic regression Q&A
  - Assignment: Is Race appropriate?
- **Day 3** (2 hrs):
  - Is hypertension appropriate?
  - Final presentation prep
- **Day 4** (1.5 hrs):

# Day 2/3: Iterating your model: what about Race/Hypertension?

- Understanding the contributions of `race`
  - How is it defined? 
  - How does our study population compare to the US?
- Understanding `hypertension` as a variable
  - Medication Lists
  - Blood pressure measurements
---

# Day 4: Final Analysis: Making and Documenting Critical Decisions

.pull-left[- Final presentation is an R Notebook

# Challenges: There is no right answer

- Data Use Agreements required for student participation
- Students wanted to choose an "optimal" threshold for models
- Challenges in understanding importance of how a clinical test would be used

---

# Outcomes

- Sets the tone for our program
- Good opportunity for clinical/bioinformatics students to meet
- Currently assessing impact on students after 1 year in program
